# Accessibility Report

## 1. Principles of Universal Design

### Principle 1: Equitable Use
- **Adhering Features:**
    - Since our project is fairly intuitive and easy to understand, most people will be able to use our app effectively. 
- **Potential Future Features:**
    - We could add text to speech to the user interface allowing those with visual impairments to use our app.
    - Localization support would be great for users who don't understand English.

### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
- **Adhering Features:**
    - This app can run on the most common operating systems that people use.
    - The user can use whichever tool they wish to move the cursor to interact with our application.
    - The user can operate this app as fast or as slow as they wish.
- **Potential Future Features:**
    - We could add a mode that makes the buttons bigger, which would be easier to press without precise control over the cursor.

### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
- **Adhering Features:**
    - Since our app's features are focused, there isn't too much complexity and is pretty intuitive to use.
    - Our UI is arranged in a way where all the primary features stand out and are easy to access with buttons that effectively prompt the user on what they need to do for the app to work.

### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
- **Adhering Features:**
    - Our UI is easy to read, with words prominently displayed in an easy to real color.
- **Potential Future Features:**
    - We could add different ways that we convey information to our user, since it is done primarily through words at the moment. For instance, we could add pictorial representations of our buttons.

### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
- **Adhering Features:**
    - This app does not cause harm to its user or their system.
    - Since our app deals directly with files on the computer, we ensured that these files are safe and do not override any existing files, makings sure to not cause our user any unnecessary distress.

### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
- **Adhering Features:**
    - Our app can be operating with any device that can control the cursor on a computer. This means that the user puts in zero to no physical effort when using our app.

### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
- **Reason for Non-Applicability:**
    - This feature applies primarily to physical object that the user must interact with.
    - Since our project is completely software based, it does not need considerations in terms of size and space.

## 2. Marketing the Program

Our application could be marketed to anyone who needs what is said in a video in text form, whether that be as subtitles, a transcript file, or a pdf; however, this is quite a broad category, so one market we could focus on are **students**. Students could use our app to download transcripts of their lectures in order to enhance their studying. If the student is learning a new language, our application could help them by translating transcripts to the language they are learning to enhance their experience. Another market we could target are **people with auditory impairments**. If they run across a video without subtitles that they cannot understand, they could use our app to automatically generate subtitles which would help them engage with overcome social limitations.

## 3. Demographics

Our application is less likely to be used by those with visual impairments, as our UI is completely visual and requires a certain level of vision to operate. While our team doesn't believe that lack of access to our app will cause a great amount of tangible harm to those who cannot access it, as it is not a necessity and is merely a convenience, it may make people with visual impairments feel as though they are not relationally equal to those who can access this convenience. Thus, it is important that we add features that allow those with visual impairments to easily use our application. For instance, we could add compatibility for screen readers that most visually impaired people use to interact with computers.
